## Slide 1
Introduction:

This is a simple app to visualize marijuana price data scraped from www.priceofweed.com.  

Note that the data is a summary from July 2015 illustrated below.

<div style='text-align: center;'>

</div>

## Slide 2 
What does the app do?

Simply adjust the maximum price ($/ounce) and the plot will highlight which states offer quality product below that rate like this example:

<div style='text-align: center;'>
    <img width='600' src='Pricing_Example.png' />
</div>

The raw data and the scraping code is available here:

## Slide 4

Why did the slide show have to be 5 pages when:
* asked to create a simple app
* brief is always > verbose
